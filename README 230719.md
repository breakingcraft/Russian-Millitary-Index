# Russian-Millitary-Index 1.46 **(WORK IN PROGRESS, WILL GET CHANGED _A LOT_)**
_Please let me know if you have suggestions or corrections. Constructive criticism is welcome._  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

## Naming Syntax:
_Issue:_
Google Earth will only let you search for things in the placemarks title, not in the description. 
Thefore the names are very long right now and needs to get shortned and a more defined syntax so units are search able by: ***Unit Name, Callsign, Type, and Location***


### I propose the following Naming Syntax:

<inactive> <Unit name (unit type) "Callsign" - (Cover name/location) <Real Location <br>
_Example:_ 
fmr 610th RTB (Eng. Base) "Blyat" - (Khabarovsk-41) Khabarovsk<br>
_Meaning:_
former 610th Repair and Technical Base (engineering base) callsign "Blyat" - (Khabarovsk-41) Khabarovsk<br>
	~~_Example, Russian to English and meaning:_
КП ЗРК ПВО = KP ZRK PVO = Command Post Anti-aircraft Missile Regiment Airforce~~


**However the: Unit Name, Callsign, Type, and Location will not be abbreviated in the folder of the units placemarks.**
